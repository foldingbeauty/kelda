# Warm up the group

To get the creative energy flowing and to be in de right mind-set to work on the definition of open-source two games will be played with the group. These games are mainly used in improvisation theater to training the brain for easy association and work great during the mind map sessions with groups.

❥ _The workshop leader will use the warming-up games twice to start session I and session II_

## Games to play
Two great warm-up games that also helps a new group to learn each other's names. For both games **everybody** in a circle.

 ❥ _The workshop leader invite everybody to stand-up and form a circle and explain the first game._

### Warm-up session I

#### Action Syllables

Everybody in a circle. First person says his name, making a gesture (an action) for every syllable. Mary has 2 syllables, so she does something like "Ma-" (wave right hand) "-ry" (claps in hands). Everyone repeats this. Then the second person calls his name, again with a gesture per syllable. Group repeats.

❥ _The workshop leader is the first person._

#### Word Ball

Everybody in a circle. One player starts by tossing a word to another player. The receiver associates on this word, and throws his association to yet another player.

### Warm-up session II

####  Whoosh

Everybody in a circle. Start with one person, who waves both hands to his/her neighbor, saying `Whoosh`. The next person passes the Whoosh to his neighbor, and that way the Whoosh is passed around the circle. 
There`s 4 other sounds/movements that can be made.

- `Boing`: indicated by saying Wow, and moving both arms down. A Wow changes the direction of the Whoosh
- `Zap`: instead of passing the Whoosh to your neighbor, it gets zapped to the person you point to. The receiver continues with either a Whoosh to his neighbor, or another Zap to another person. A Wow after a Zap returns to the Zapper.

If the group is ready for more action:

- `Groooooooovelicious`: for this one the whole group bends down and up again in a kinda groovy way, all saying Groooooooovelicious. Afterwards, the person who started the Groovelicious sets the Whoosh in motion again, in any direction.
- `Freakout`: indicated by waving both hands in the air. Everybody starts screaming and moves to the center of the circle. When everybody`s freaked out a new circle is formed, and the starter of the Freakout sets the Whoosh in motion again (or Zaps, or does a Grooooooovelicious).

**Variations**

You can invent other sounds and gestures. You might replace Whoosh by a kind of Vroom-Vroom, as is you're in a car, and replace Wow by the sounds of brakes (`iiiii`) etc. Also known as Zip Zap Zoop.
